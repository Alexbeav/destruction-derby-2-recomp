# Development log

## 2026-09-01 — setup executable-name parity

The public `v0.3.0` source used different CMake and setup-relaunch executable
names. The corrected source uses `Destruction_Derby_2_Recompiled` in all three title-owned paths.
`Test-SetupExecutableNameParity.ps1` passes. Exact-ZIP automatic relaunch is
still required before release.

## 2026-09-02 — canonical multi-BIN verification failure

The mandatory corpus check found no existing exact match. The consult-test-return
loop then reviewed the release verifier and hashed the owned merged image only
through Track 02 `INDEX 00`. The public configuration stores the merged
650,586,720-byte image identity while its comment calls the values Track 01
digests. A standard CUE makes the verifier hash the real 73,330,656-byte Track
01 file instead. Its MD5 is `c8e98530e2b1ddcf54e1ac2326ae8127` and its SHA-1
is `d52c60282b7ae07639b8fd61b0ab8d35b28a3327`.

The corrected package accepted the canonical Track 01 and the original merged
CUE on Pegasus. It generated, rebuilt, launched through the setup helper, and
exited cleanly. The first package included two non-SDK scripts with a developer
path. Packaging revision `r2` removes only those files. Shared records:
`PSX-PUB-020`, `FAIL-115`, `FAIL-104`, and `PSX-PUB-016`.

## 2026-09-04 v0.3.6 POSIX setup-copy candidate

This candidate pins PSXRecomp 08ec704a974b1f3a16335b4afeb340b9eff19926 and recomp-ui be8ac1d03ee19d55394b5a5f2d9d1506edd56659.
Linux and macOS packages use native CMake, Ninja, Python, C, and C++ tools.
Windows keeps the portable toolchain route. This change does not change game
code or the graduation state. Build-only CI and every exact-package release
gate must pass before publication.

## 2026-09-13 - Reconcile published source into main

The default branch now includes the published v0.3.6 source. The release workflow uses the existing PSX-PUB-031 indentation repair. Later catalog identities and the current recomp-ui repository URL are preserved. The pinned runtime and UI commits match v0.3.6. No new package, release, gameplay test, or source-pin promotion is claimed.

Corpus consulted: PSX-PUB-031 and FAIL-142. The existing audit_release_workflow.py parser and regression supply the repair. Primary reference: https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release documents overwrite_files under with. Source checks cover YAML structure, Actionlint, title executable-name tests when present, manifest versions, and exact release gitlinks.
